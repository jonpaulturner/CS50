Open memory card file
  fopen
    need to check if function returns null value

Find beginning of JPEG
    First 3 bytes: 0xff 0xd8 0xff
    Each block is 512 bytes
    Stored back to back

Open a new JPEG
    fread(data, size, number, inptr);
        data: pointer to struct that contains bytes to be read
        size: size of each element to read (sizeof)
        number: number of elements to read
        inptr: FILE * to read from

        fread(buffer, 512, 1,

    Walk through each block, checking for the first JPEG header
    Once it's found, start writing blocks to JPEG file until
        a new JPEG header is found



Write 512 bytes until new JPEG is found
    Write these bytes into a buffer
    if (buffer[0] == 0xff &&
        buffer[1] == 0xd8 &&
        buffer[2] == 0xff &&
        (buffer[3] & 0xf0) == 0xe0)


Creating and opening new JPEG files:
    Keep track of current jpeg file number
    sprintf(filename, "%03i.jpg", 2);
        filename: char array to store the resultant string (i.e. 001, 002)
    FILE *img = fopen(filename, "w");

Write 512 bytes to our new JPEG
    fwrite(data, size, number, outptr);
        data: pointer to the struct that contains the bytes you're reading from
            buffer?
        size
        number
        outptr: FILE * to write to (new image file created above)

Detect end of file
    Read 512 1 byte blocks in
    Use a conditional to make sure it returned 512 bytes from fread
    If not, it's the end of a file

    if number ==512, do jpeg stuff
    else end file

    ----------------------------------------------------

Open card file
repeat until end of card
    read 512 bytes into a buffer
    start of a new JPEG?
        yes? Start our very first JPEG, or if we've already found one,
            close the current file and open a new one
        no?  See below
    Already found a JPEG?
        no? discard those bytes
        yes? write those bytes to the current file
close any remaining files
